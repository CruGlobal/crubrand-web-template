# Crubrand Web Template
Web template for housing the crubrand framework


The custom-example and generic-example folders show two different ways to work with crubrand. If you are purely interested in getting up and running as quickly as possible see the generic-example. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty, eliminate imports that are unnecessary to your project and better control the cascade follow the custom-example.
